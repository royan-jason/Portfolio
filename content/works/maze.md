    - Adaptive Lighting Systems is one of the subsets of ADAS systems for passenger satefy. By reading the position of the oncoming vehicle via camera and sensors, its position can be predicted and specific LEDs from the LED matrix will be turned off . The ALS system constantly reads the oncoming vehicle's position as it approaches and switches off the LEDs in a corresponding pattern. The idea behind this project is for it to be as cost efficient as possible to implement.
